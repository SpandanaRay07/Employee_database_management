# Employee_database_management
This project implements a simple Employee Database Management System using Java. It allows users to input employee details such as name, ID, salary, hire date, job position, contact number, and address. The system stores up to 500 employee records and provides various features to manage and retrieve employee data.
Key Features:
•	Add Employee Records: Input employee details including personal information, job position, hire date, and contact details.
•	Filter by Job Position: Retrieve employees by specific job positions like "Manager."
•	Filter by Hire Date: Display employees hired within a specified date range.
•	Count Foreign Employees: Count employees based on their contact numbers (foreign if the number doesn't start with '91').
•	Filter by Salary Range: Retrieve employees whose salaries fall within a specified range.
This project helps in managing and organizing employee data efficiently.
